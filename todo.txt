--TODO--

--DOING--

Create the shotgun with the new shooting so it shoots a spread shot
--
Create boss enemies that have a chance to spawn from a specific round 
(limit to x per round)
--
Create a buy mechanic either like in zombies(wall buys/box) or a csgo/shop system 
--
Create buyable perks that increase the player stats 
--
Create the map editor to create maps 
--
Draw some basic sprites as concepts for the look of the game
--


--DONE--

Redo the shooting so the projectiles move in a straight line instead of targeting a enemy
(gun follows the mouse and on click it shoots a projectile to that direction)
